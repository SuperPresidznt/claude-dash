# Cody UX Merge Plan for Project 3

This document points to the primary UX merge spec and gives your coder a friendly entry point.

- **Primary detailed spec:** `docs/ux-merge-from-project-2.md`
- **Goal:** Keep project 3's architecture and charts, while adopting project 2's best UX patterns (dashboard, ideas journal, tasks Kanban with WIP, finance KPIs UX, metrics extensions, reviews).

Your coder should:
- Start by reading `ux-merge-from-project-2.md` for the full phased plan.
- Treat this `cody-ux-merge-plan.md` file as the "start here" marker when looking for Cody's guidance.

For implementation details (routes, components, APIs, and phases), follow the step-by-step outline in `ux-merge-from-project-2.md`.
